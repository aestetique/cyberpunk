// Tools useful for using from Foundry's F12 console that don't particularly have a place elsewhere.
// To use the below functions in console, run `const DevTools = await import("./systems/cp2020/module/dev-tools.js")`
// You can then run them with DevTools.functionName

// Note: Compendium-related functions (compendiumItems, exampleCompendiumItem, fixAttackSkillUndefineds)
// have been removed as compendiums are no longer distributed with this system.
